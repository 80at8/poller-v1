#The number of times to fork fping. Generally not productive to set too high, and may cause significant jitter/packet loss due to flooding of NIC.
ICMP_FORKS=10
#The number of simultaneous SNMP pollers to instantiate. This will consume additional RAM, CPU, and system resources such as file descriptors.
SNMP_FORKS=250
#The timeout in seconds to wait for SNMP results. This can be a decimal. The higher this is, the more polling will be delayed with a lot of down devices.
SNMP_TIMEOUT=1
#The amount of times to retry an SNMP query. Setting this very low will result in false down states if the device exceeds the SNMP_TIMEOUT value temporarily. Setting it high will significantly increase the amount of time an SNMP polling cycle takes.
SNMP_RETRIES=0
#The timeout in seconds to wait for ICMP results. This can be a decimal. The higher this is, the more polling will be delayed with a lot of down devices.
ICMP_TIMEOUT=2

#Set this to true to enable additional debug logging to /var/log/sonar_poller.log. Not recommended for production.
